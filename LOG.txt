Wednesday:	
	Meeting with Prashant where we presented the two papers mentioned above and discussed what we want to research more about.
	Need to decide if we e.g. want to do benchmark testing or/and see if we can both find the epistemic uncertainty from the deterministic 
	embeddings and also find the aleatoric uncertainty from the data and in which field we want to focus, continue on CLIP or try to find 
	uncertainties in e.g. healthcare.
